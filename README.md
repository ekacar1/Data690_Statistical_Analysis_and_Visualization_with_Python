## Course Format and Assignments
Students will complete weekly/bi-weekly assignments and a project to gain practical experience in Python programming, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Grading Criteria
- Attendance: 7%
- Homework Assignments: 35%
- Midterm 25%
- Project: 33%

Final grade might be computed as follows: 
- 90% - 100% A
- 86% - 89% A-
- 82% - 85% B +
- 76% - 81% B 
- 70% - 75% B-
- 66% - 69% C+
- 62% - 65% C
- 55% - 61% C-
- 40% - 54% D
- <40% F
  
However, someone with a final score of 84 might also get an A-, depending on the overall success of the
students. (Of course, same thing might happen in the opposite direction).
Course Policies
## Course Policies
 UMBC provides a range of writing assistance, which can be found in the following:
- The Writing Center https://lrc.umbc.edu/tutor/writing-center/
-  Research Guides & Tutorials https://lib.guides.umbc.edu/tutorial



Failure to follow guidelines for each assignment, including the required format, style, length,
submission, etc., may result in at least one-letter-grade reduction on the paper depending on the type
and/or number of transgressions.

Late/Incomplete assignments will not be accepted unless an extension has been agreed to in advance.
Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case basis with appropriate justification and/or
documentation.

Incomplete grades will not be entertained unless extenuating circumstances warrant and your request is
made before the last week of class.

## Academic Integrity
By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s
scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards
of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of
academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that
may include, but is not limited to, failure, suspension or dismissal.
